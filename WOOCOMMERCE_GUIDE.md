# How to Run and Access the WooCommerce Application

This document explains how to install and access the WooCommerce plugin within your WordPress application.

## Installing WooCommerce

Since the automatic installation of WooCommerce could not be completed, you will need to install it manually.

1.  **Log in to the WordPress Admin Panel:** Follow the instructions in `WORDPRESS_GUIDE.md` to access your WordPress dashboard.
2.  **Navigate to Plugins:** In the left-hand menu, click on "Plugins" and then "Add New".
3.  **Search for WooCommerce:** In the search bar, type "WooCommerce" and press Enter.
4.  **Install and Activate:** Find the WooCommerce plugin in the search results and click "Install Now". Once it's installed, click "Activate".

## Accessing WooCommerce Settings

Once WooCommerce is activated, you can access its settings from the WordPress admin panel.

1.  **WooCommerce Menu:** You will see a new "WooCommerce" menu item in the left-hand menu.
2.  **Settings:** Click on "WooCommerce" and then "Settings" to configure your store.

## Viewing the WooCommerce Shop

WooCommerce automatically creates a "Shop" page on your site.

1.  **Find the Shop Page:** In the admin panel, go to "Pages" to see the "Shop" page.
2.  **View the Shop:** You can view the shop page by appending `/shop` to the URL you found in the "Ports" tab.
